# Using Objects Practice

## Rectangles

Start by reading through the `Rectangle.java` code. 
1)    What does a rectangle object know?
2)    How many different ways are there to create rectangle objects?
3)    What can a rectangle object do?

Next start working through the `// TODO tasks` on `RectangleTester.java` with your partner. Discuss what is going on as well as what changes you are making. 


## Circle
With your partner, start thinking about how you might write a Circle class. Then add the appropriate fields, constructors and methods to `Circle.java`. You should use `Rectangle.java` as a guide.

Once you have the Circle class written, you need to create a CircleTester class. This will be a separate file with a main method and you will create a few Circle objects and print information about them using the methods that you wrote.
